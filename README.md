### Earnings/Tax Breakdown Calculator

*This program is still in its BETA/WIP stage, I am adding more features continually.*

There are no dependencies required to run this program.

After importing/cloning the code, make sure you're in the ```tax-calculator``` folder in your terminal and run the command:

Windows: ```python main.py```

MacOS: ```python3 main.py```

This terminal program will calculate your Tax Rate, Net Pay, Check Amount, Hourly Pay Total, Overtime Pay, and Gross Earnings based off inputting your regular hours worked, hourly rate, cash tips earned, overtime hours/overtime rate, taxes withheld, and total deductions (benefits, 401K, etc. if applicable). It only allows the user to enter correct values i.e. strings, floated integers, date (where/when appropriate). All validations work.

It will also allow you to save the output of your earnings/tax breakdown to a text file. The idea is to eventually be able to have a record of your entries and be able to see a print out of multiple weeks' paystubs.

*Note*: The best way to use this program is by ensuring you have one of your checks handy already. Otherwise, you can estimate the values if you wanted to--but the calculations are intended to be exact based off your paystub.
