### Earnings/Tax Breakdown Calculator

There are no dependencies required to run this program.

After importing/cloning the code, make sure you're in the ```tax-calculator``` folder in your terminal and run the command:

Windows: ```python main.py```

MacOS: ```python3 main.py```

This mini-program will calculate your $Tax Rate$ %, $Net Pay$, $Check Amount$, $Hourly Pay Total$, and $Gross Earnings$ based off inputting your regular hours worked, hourly rate, cash tips earned, taxes withheld, and total deductions.

*Note*: The best way to use this program is by ensuring you have one of your checks handy already. Otherwise, you can estimate the values if you wanted to--but the calculations are intended to be exact based off your paystub.
